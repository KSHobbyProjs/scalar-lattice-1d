## 1+1D Lattice QFT Simulation
This project implements a lattice quantum field theory(QFT) in 1+1 dimensions for a real, scalar field with a quartic coupling potential. It demonstrates how to numerically study quantum field theories using lattice discretization and Monte Carlo sampling techniques.
### Overview
**Theory**: Scalar field $\phi(x,t)$ with Lagrangian.
A lattice qft simulation in 1+1D with a scalar quartic-potential Lagrangian. We discretize spacetime into a lattice, and use Monte Carlo techniques (metropolis algorithm) to sample field configurations from the Euclidean path integral. We calculate two-point correlation functions, field expectation values, susceptibility, and the Binder cumulant.
