# scalar-lattice-1d
A lattice qft simulation in 1+1D with a scalar quartic-potential Lagrangian. We discretize spacetime into a lattice, and use Monte Carlo techniques (metropolis algorithm) to sample field configurations from the Euclidean path integral. We calculate two-point correlation functions, field expectation values, susceptibility, and the Binder cumulant.
